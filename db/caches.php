/**
 * MUC (Moodle Universal Cache) definitions for customcertelement_assignfeedbackcomments.
 *
 * Defines the 'feedbackcache' request-scoped cache used by element::get_feedback_for_user()
 * to avoid redundant DB round-trips when the same feedback is rendered by multiple
 * certificate elements during a single certificate generation request.
 *
 * Cache behaviour:
 * - mode: request  — lives only for the lifetime of the current PHP process.
 *                    No stale data risk; no cross-user contamination possible.
 * - No TTL required — the request store is automatically purged at process end.
 * - On high-traffic sites, this prevents duplicate JOIN queries when the same
 *   assignment feedback element appears more than once on a certificate template.
